== Supported Hardware ==
This node works with TeraRanger '''Evo 60m''', TeraRanger '''Evo 600Hz''', TeraRanger '''Evo 3m''' , TeraRanger '''One''' and TeraRanger '''Duo'''. You can find more information below.

TeraRanger '''Evo 60m''' is the long range Time-of-Flight distance sensor of the TeraRanger product family.
It provides calibrated distance readings in millimetres and has a range up to 60m, whilst remaining lightweight and small! Instead of laser, TeraRanger Evo uses LED technology.
React faster and detect obstacles with greater assurance, TeraRanger '''Evo 600Hz''' is perfect for high-speed collision avoidance and object detection solution!
With its 10cm to 3m range, 100Hz fixed update rate and greater accuracy(+/-2cm), the TeraRanger '''Evo 3m''', is optimized for close-range distance measurement.
